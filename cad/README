MakerNexus modifications to address local healthcare community feedback.

Initial changes to Adafruit's model of Prusa RC2:

  * Move pins to middle of band to close gaps behind shield
  * Make lighter (we thinned the band).
  * Make the radii of crevices larger to facilitate easier cleaning.

4/3/2020:

  * Make radii smaller to bring back some flexibility
  * Fix divots at top which extended too far and missing radii
  * Make divot offset 0.7 to accommodate 0.6 nozzle (experimental)

The baseline STL we were starting out with.
